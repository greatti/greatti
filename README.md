My name is Brenno Greatti, im a Graduation student in Theoretical Physics at University of MaringÃ¡ (BRAZIL). I love solving problems using Python, especially those involving data analysis and data visualization. Today i gave a little break for my Python studies and im learning a little front-end because i judged super important too, so im doing courses in CSS and HTML to jump into Javascript in the future. Also, im improving my knowledges in Python to jump into Julia.
I have some hobbies too: i really love to draw and i learned Illustrator and Photoshop, so sometimes im doing some art there; and reading, im not the kind of reader that got used by PDF's so i have a little library in my home where i can spend hours reading about stuff, mostly physics and nature. 
Today i started to give some beauty to my github and i hope i have finished at the time you are reading this, please enjoy!

For my programming projects, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress, and im starting now to learn how to use the Conventional and Atomic commits, so maybe some projects can still be a little bit messy. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.

I program for 3 years but there is little time since when I started to really love it, so i've done some little projects that im proud of: 

>>>My Julia Study project is a new repository i'm creating to estimulate the JuliaLang learning. It is the last language im learning and i wanted to pass it to people, based on my reading and my interpretation of Julia Documentation. In READ-ME you can find what each class is about and how to download Julia and nteract software, that i use for my tutorials

>>>My first "complex' page. This webpage i made using only HTML and CSS, because im learning JS just now, and someday i will start applying my knowledges aquired in this language. This page consists in a Product_page, that means that the "host" put in that page something that he wants to sell, and im proud of my work because the site is so complete in my view, and i dont want to talk much about it but you can see the full description in [here](https://github.com/greatti/Product_page).

>>>My data project that im creating now! Basically i will create 3 or 4 repositorys of different levels of DataAnalysis, and the idea is to put there DataScience content using Python with Pandas/Numpy/Matplot/Seaborn. In every directory we will have another directory called "Concepts" where i upload the "classes" explaining functions of this libraries, and when I finish putting the concepts, I post about 3 or 4 projects made my way, but that readers can recreate in their own way too, using other concepts and exploring even beyond what I did. You can find it in [here](https://github.com/greatti/Data_studies) the introductory course.
