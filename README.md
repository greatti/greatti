My name is Brenno Greatti, im a Graduation student in Theoretical Physics at University of MaringÃ¡ (BRAZIL). I love solving problems using Python, especially those involving data analysis and data visualization. Today i gave a little break for my Python studies and im learning a little front-end because i judged super important too, so im doing courses in CSS and HTML to jump into Javascript in the future.
I have some hobbies too: i really love to draw and i learned Illustrator and Photoshop, so sometimes im doing some art there; and reading, im not the kind of reader that got used by PDF's so i have a little library in my home where i can spend hours reading about stuff, mostly physics and nature. 
Today i started to give some beauty to my github and i hope i have finished at the time you are reading this, please enjoy!

For my programming projects, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress, and im starting now to learn how to use the Conventional and Atomic commits, so maybe some projects can still be a little bit messy. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.

I program for 3 years but there is little time since when I started to really love it, so i've done some little projects that im proud of: 

>>>A data visualization project studying the influence of investment in sports when compared to crime rate over the years. It was a small project but at the same time it was the first one that i made fully by myself, i had to search the data, get the data, compile the data, clean the data, analyze the data and plot the relashion between the variables. It was the graduation project of my last University Of Michigan Data Visualization course, i really loved it and this will be in one of my repositories; 

>>>My first "complex' page. This webpage i made using only HTML and CSS, because im learning JS just now, and someday i will start applying my knowledges aquired in this language. This page consists in a Product_page, that means that the "host" put in that page something that he wants to sell, and im proud of my work because the site is so complete in my view, and i dont want to talk much about it but you can see the full description in [here](https://github.com/greatti/Product_page).

>>>My data project that im creating now! Basically i will create 3 or 4 repositorys of different levels of DataAnalysis, and the idea is to put there DataScience content using Python with Pandas/Numpy/Matplot/Seaborn. I every directory we will have another directory called "Concepts" where i upload the "classes" explaining functions of this libraries, and when I finish putting the concepts, I post about 3 or 4 projects made my way, but that readers can recreate in their own way too, using other concepts and exploring even beyond what I did. Now, 03/23/2021, i finished working on the First Project of the First study in data, and you can find it in [here](https://github.com/greatti/Data_studies).
